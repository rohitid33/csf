# **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

### **How do I know if Debt Relief or Loan Settlement is the best option for me?**

Debt relief isn’t just reducing the debt owed by you, it is about eliminating your debt and living a debt free life. If you are living paycheck to paycheck because of the debt that you owe or if you are already behind on your monthly payments, chances are that you need debt relief.

### **What types of debt can FREED help me with?**

Most of your unsecured debts (not backed by a collateral) can be enrolled. If the majority of your debt load consists of personal loans, credit card debts, payday loans, BNPL loans; you can expect a good result from our Debt Relief Platform.

### **How does Debt Relief or Loan Settlement affect my Credit?**

Not paying your credit dues or barely making the minimum payment on your credit cards every month impacts your credit score negatively. FREED’s Debt Relief Program may or may not affect your credit score depending on the program you qualify for. FREED’s Debt Resolution Program will have a negative impact on your credit score and rating, but once your debts are settled, your score will gradually improve. However, if you qualify for FREED’s Debt Consolidation Program, your score would not get impacted negatively, rather your score will start to improve.

### **How much does Debt Relief Cost?**

The cost of debt relief will vary depending on the program you qualify for. Your financial profile, debt load, affordability, and goals can significantly affect the cost of Debt Relief for you. However, we fully understand that customers looking for debt relief should not be financially burdened any further. FREED’s Debt Relief Programs are structured to ensure that even after paying our fees, customers save significantly* on their total outstanding debt.

### **How much will I save with FREED's Debt Relief?**

Your savings on FREED’s Debt Relief Programs are dependent on your debt load, affordability, complete financial profile, and financial goals. Depending on the Debt Relief Program you qualify for, you will be able to save between 10%-30%* on your monthly EMIs or up to 50%* on your total outstanding debt load.

### **Disclaimer**

- Please note that clients who are able to stay in the program and get their debts settled realize approximate savings of 50% before our fees and 35% including our fees. All claims are estimates and are based on the enrolled debts and the program tenure. Not all clients are able to complete their program for various reasons, including their ability to keep up with the program payments and save sufficient funds. Not all debts are eligible for enrollment in the Debt Resolution program. FREED doesn’t recommend enrollment in a Debt Resolution Program unless there is a genuine financial hardship experienced by a client leading to non-payment of dues.

There is no guarantee that your debts would be resolved within a specific period of time or they would be lowered by a specific amount or percentage. We do not assume your debts, make monthly payments to your creditors or provide tax, accounting or legal advice. Please read and understand all program details prior to enrollment. Enrolling in the Debt Resolution Program will have an adverse impact on your credit rating and may result in you being subjected to aggressive collection measures or even being sued by creditors. The accounts you enroll may continue to accrue fees and interest, however, negotiated settlements that we obtain on your behalf would resolve the entire account balance, including accrued fees and interest.

## **How Loan Settlement Works**

**Sign-up**

The first step in your journey towards a debt-free life is signing up for FREED’s program. This involves paying an evaluation fee based on your loan amount to initiate the loan settlement process.

**Evaluation**

After signing up, our counselor will evaluate your loans based on your income and expenses to offer you a customized debt resolution program. This step includes a credit report check to assess your loans.

**Savings**

Once enrolled, you fast-track your journey by saving in an SPA account (Special Purpose Account). Each month, you will deposit a specific amount into this account. These savings will later be utilized during the negotiation stage with your lenders.

**Negotiation**

Once enough funds have been accumulated in your special purpose account, our dedicated team will begin negotiations with your lender to reach a settlement amount. This could result in a significant reduction in your owed amount compared to the original loan amount. Our team will handle the entire process on your behalf.

**Debt-free Life Begins**

The final step in your journey is when, after successful negotiations, your lender provides a settlement offer. Once you accept the offer—Congratulations! You’re Debt Free!
