     - Timestamps (creation, expiration)
     - Status tracking (used/unused)
   - Basic API Endpoints
     - `/api/auth/send-otp`
     - `/api/auth/verify-otp`
   - Basic Security Implementation
     - Simple rate limiting
     - Basic OTP expiration (5 minutes)

2. Frontend Components:
   - Basic OTP Input UI
     - 6-digit input field
     - Basic validation
   - Initial Auth Flow Integration
     - Username/email input screen
     - OTP entry screen
   - Basic Error Handling
     - Invalid OTP messages
     - Expiration notifications

3. Core Authentication Logic:
   - OTP Generation Service
   - Basic Verification Flow
   - Session Management Updates

**PHASE 2: Enhanced Security & User Experience**
1. Advanced Security Features:
   - Enhanced Rate Limiting

   - User Adoption Analytics

**PHASE 4: Final Migration & Cleanup**
1. Password Deprecation:
   - Mark Password Fields Optional
   - User Migration Notifications
   - Legacy Data Handling
   - Password Field Removal

2. System Cleanup:
   - Remove Password-related Code
     - Authentication logic
     - API endpoints
     - Database fields
   - Update Documentation
     - API documentation
     - User guides
     - Security documentation

3. Final Security Review:
   - Security Audit
   - Performance Testing
   - Load Testing
   - Penetration Testing

4. Maintenance & Monitoring:
   - System Health Checks
   - Performance Monitoring
   - Security Monitoring
   - User Feedback Collection

Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a smooth transition while maintaining security and user experience. The phases are designed to be implemented sequentially, with each phase having clear deliverables and success criteria.
