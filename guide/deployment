AWS Deployment Process for Web Application
Here's a comprehensive, phased approach to deploy your web application to AWS:

Phase 1: Preparation and Setup
AWS Account Setup

Create an AWS account if you don't have one
Set up IAM users with appropriate permissions
Configure MFA for added security
Environment Planning

Define deployment environments (dev, staging, production)
Determine AWS regions based on your target audience
Document architecture requirements (compute, storage, networking)
Domain and SSL

Register a domain in Route 53 or configure your existing domain
Request SSL certificates through AWS Certificate Manager



Phase 2: Infrastructure Provisioning
Network Setup

Create a VPC with public and private subnets
Configure security groups and network ACLs
Set up NAT gateways for private subnets
Infrastructure as Code

Choose a tool (AWS CloudFormation, Terraform, AWS CDK)
Create templates for your infrastructure
Version control your infrastructure code
Core Services Setup

Configure S3 buckets for static assets
Set up CloudFront for content delivery (if needed)
Configure load balancing with Application Load Balancer
Phase 3: Deployment Environment
Compute Environment

Choose appropriate compute service:
EC2 instances for traditional deployments
ECS/EKS for containerized applications
AWS Lambda for serverless components
Elastic Beanstalk for simplified deployments
Database Setup

Set up RDS for relational databases
Configure backup and maintenance windows
Implement encryption and security measures
Caching and Performance

Set up ElastiCache for caching (if needed)
Configure CloudFront distributions
Implement auto-scaling policies
Phase 4: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
CI/CD Pipeline

Set up AWS CodePipeline or integrate with GitHub Actions/Jenkins
Configure source integration with your repository
Define build specifications
Build Process

Set up AWS CodeBuild or equivalent
Configure build environment and dependencies
Create build scripts for your application
Deployment Configuration

Set up AWS CodeDeploy or equivalent
Configure deployment groups
Define deployment strategies (blue/green, canary, etc.)
Phase 5: Application Configuration
Environment Variables

Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for configuration
Configure secrets in AWS Secrets Manager
Set up environment-specific variables
Logging and Monitoring

Configure CloudWatch Logs
Set up CloudWatch Alarms for critical metrics
Implement X-Ray for distributed tracing (if applicable)
Access Control

Configure IAM roles for services
Set up application-level authentication
Implement AWS WAF for web application firewall protection
Phase 6: Testing and Validation
Environment Testing

Validate infrastructure connectivity
Test load balancing and failover
Verify auto-scaling functionality
Application Testing

Deploy to staging environment first
Conduct integration and end-to-end tests
Perform load testing with tools like AWS Load Testing
Security Testing

Conduct vulnerability scanning
Perform penetration testing (with AWS approval)
Review IAM permissions and security groups
Phase 7: Production Deployment
Final Checklist

Review all configuration
Verify database backups and restore procedures
Ensure monitoring is properly configured
Deployment Execution

Execute production deployment through CI/CD pipeline
Monitor deployment progress
Verify application functionality
DNS Configuration

Update DNS records to point to your AWS resources
Configure DNS routing policies (if needed)
Phase 8: Post-Deployment
Monitoring and Alerting

Ensure all metrics are being collected
Configure dashboards for key performance indicators
Set up on-call rotations and alert notifications
Backup and Disaster Recovery

Implement automated backups
Test disaster recovery procedures
Document recovery time objectives and procedures
Optimization

Review costs and implement cost-saving measures
Optimize performance based on metrics
Implement reserved instances or savings plans
This phased approach ensures a methodical, reliable deployment of your web application to AWS with proper security, monitoring, and maintenance considerations.
