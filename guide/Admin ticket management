Ticket Management Interface Implementation Plan


Phase 1: Data Model Design
Review existing Ticket model

Ensure it has necessary fields: ID, user ID, title, description, status, priority, creation date, last updated date
Check if any modifications are needed for advanced management features
Create Task model for tickets

Fields: ID, ticket ID (foreign key), title, description, status, created date, due date, assignee
Define relationships between Ticket and Task models
Add timestamps for creation and updates


Phase 2: Backend API Development
Create/enhance ticket endpoints

GET endpoint to retrieve all tickets for admin view with pagination and filtering
GET endpoint to fetch single ticket with detailed information
PUT endpoint to update ticket information (status, priority, etc.)
DELETE endpoint (if needed) with proper access controls
Develop task management endpoints

POST endpoint to create new tasks for a specific ticket
GET endpoint to retrieve all tasks for a specific ticket
PUT endpoint to update task status, description, or due dates
DELETE endpoint to remove tasks from tickets
Implement permissions and validation

Ensure only admin users can access management features
Validate all incoming data before processing


Phase 3: Admin Interface Development
Ticket listing interface

Create a tabular view displaying all user tickets
Include columns: Ticket ID, User, Title, Status, Priority, Created Date, Last Updated
Implement sorting and filtering capabilities
Add pagination for large datasets
Make rows clickable to navigate to detailed view
Ticket detail view

Design form to display all ticket information
Create editable fields for ticket properties (status, priority, etc.)
Add save/cancel buttons for modifications
Include ticket history/activity log section
Display user information who created the ticket
Task management section

Add a task list section within ticket detail view
Create "Add Task" button and form with fields for title, description, due date, etc.
Implement task editing functionality
Add task status toggle controls
Include task deletion with confirmation
UI/UX considerations

Design intuitive status indicators using colors/icons
Add confirmation dialogs for important actions
Implement loading states for async operations
Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes


Phase 4: User Interface Updates
Enhance user ticket detail view
Update user interface to display tasks assigned to their tickets
Create a clean, informative task listing format
Add visual indicators for task status (pending, in progress, completed)
Potentially add notification system for new tasks


Phase 5: Testing and Deployment
Testing strategy

Unit tests for backend logic and API endpoints
Integration tests for ticket and task functionality
User acceptance testing for admin interface
Performance testing for large ticket databases
Deployment planning

Database migration strategy
Phased rollout approach
Monitoring setup for potential issues
Backup and rollback procedures
Phase 6: Documentation and Training
Documentation

Create admin user documentation for ticket management
Update API documentation with new endpoints
Document database schema changes
Admin training

Prepare training materials for admin staff
Schedule training sessions for new functionality
